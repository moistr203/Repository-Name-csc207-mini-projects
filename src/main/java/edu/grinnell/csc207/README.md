# Classical Encryption Project

**Author**: Moise Milenge

This project implements classical encryption techniques such as Caesar cipher and Vigen√®re cipher. It includes:
- A utility class `CipherUtils` that provides static methods for encrypting and decrypting text using both ciphers.
- A command-line utility `AllCaesar` that prints all possible Caesar cipher shifts.
- Another command-line utility `Cipher` that allows flexible encoding/decoding using either cipher.
